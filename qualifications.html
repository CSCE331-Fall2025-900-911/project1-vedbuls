<h3>AI Intern - InfoMarines Inc. | Online | Ongoing | July 2025</h3>
<p>
  During my AI internship at InfoMarines Inc., I gained hands-on experience working with AI technologies,
  including Large Language Models (LLMs) and embeddings. I assisted in developing and testing AI projects using tools
  such as Ollama and LLaMA, and supported the team in building retrieval-based systems that efficiently find relevant
  information from large datasets. I also collaborated with the team on documentation, meetings, and code management,
  which helped me strengthen both my technical and professional skills in a real-world AI development environment.

  I am passionate about web development, data analysis, and machine learning. I love web development because I enjoy the process of making useful and user-friendly applications that have purpose. I love data analysis because math excites me, and I like making insights and getting ideas from raw data. Machine learning fascinates me because it allows models to learn from data by adjusting their parameters based on correct and incorrect predictions, improving performance over time.
