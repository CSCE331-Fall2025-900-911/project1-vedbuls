                <p>
                    Hello! I am Ved Bulusu, a sophomore computer science student with a passion for coding,
                    problem-solving, and technology. My main goal is to enhance my programming skills
                    with experience through personal projects and internships.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You can learn more about me as a computer science student here. This site shows my
                    personality, goals, technical projects, and skills, displays my qualifications and
                    interests, as well as the ways I give back to my community.
                </p>
                <br><br><br><br>

                <p>
                    I enjoy working on challenging projects, learning new concepts, and trying out new
                    tools. I stay positive and keep going until completion, even when things get hard.
                    I work well with others by listening and understanding, valuing communication,
                    and helping others. Outside of coding, I enjoy playing chess and sports, which keep
                    me strategic, competitive, and concentrated.
